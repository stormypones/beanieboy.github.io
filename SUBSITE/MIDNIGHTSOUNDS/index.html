            AFTERPARTY is a long look back at my journey as a person, artist and my childhood in California.
            This song stands as a love letter to my fans, my family and my friends, both old and new. This
            song stands as a grateful after party for my first two decades of life. Following this comes a
            much more somber hidden track titled "SIGNOFF". Originally to be a ballad for a lost lover now
            turned my sign off into my next decade, with a hint of mystery of what's to come next.
