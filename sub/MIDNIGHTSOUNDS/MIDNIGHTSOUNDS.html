			MIDNIGHTSOUNDS is a seven months in the making passion project for myself. Since 
			before July, I started listening to more lo-fi and abstract artists such as MIKE, 
			The Koreatown Oddity and JIMMY, inspiring me to take a more laid-back approach 
			to songs and take on a more retro sound. <br><br>
			The deep voice you hear throughout the 
			album announcing the station is none other than Big B, the radio host of 115.5 
			MDNT FM. In my childhood years, I would often take drives with my family to drop 
			off my little brother and on the way back we would pass through none other 
			than Malibu. I was absolutely mesmerized by the shimmering waves and golden 
			sunset. I could smell the ozone just by looking at it. All the while, my parents 
			had the radio cranked up listening to the oldies but goodies broadcast by none 
			other than Art Laboe. He was a radio host known for having folks come onto his 
			show and dedicate songs to folks around the area. Most of the people that were 
			on air would usually dedicate the song to an incarcerated loved one or even 
			someone halfway across the country.<br><br> I thought it was outstanding that a decades 
			old technology could still connect folks to this day. Going into MIDNIGHTSOUNDS, 
			I wanted to capture that energy, that love, that connectivity, all of it. After 
			numerous name changes, edits and the like, I am more than happy to share this 
			journey with you all, be it fans, family, and friends.
