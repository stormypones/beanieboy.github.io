            FUTUREV1SION is a project that I've wanted to make for a long time. This project takes inspiration from film for it's atmosphere, drawing you in with the first track as you follow me through a hazy night of self discovery.<br><br>
			
			GOLDENIGHT is the beginning of the journey. I slowly find myself slipping into my mind as I think back on my life, all while entranced by smoke. <br><br> 
			SPRAYPAINT finds me falling deeper, my mind now surrounding me as I begin my journey. DREAMER takes this raw emotion and presents it in an alternate light, the opposite side of the coin, if you will. <br><br>
			CANVAS is a deeper look at what it means to be an artists through my eyes, with the idea that anyone can do it being quite prevelant.<br><br>
			Finally, we come upon INNERVISION, completing my journey as I come to terms with the things I've learned and figuring out how to use them to become better.
			<br><br>
			This project meant a lot to me, and was certainly a means of growth for myself, both as a person and an artist. I wanted to prove that I could do more than sample and spit some corny bars here and there. I wanted to show I could make art. <br><br>
			FUTUREV1SION is that art.
