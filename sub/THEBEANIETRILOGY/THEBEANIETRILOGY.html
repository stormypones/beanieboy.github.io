			Ever since I was a kid I loved 
			trilogies as they were a small glimspe into  a world once unseen
			<br><br>
			Creating the world of 
			THE BEANIE TRILOGY 
			over the course of a year was an 
			absolutely amazing process
			and I couldnt have done
			it without all of your support
<br><br>
			Going from writing lyrics
			down on sticky notes at 
			work to telling my story for 
			everyone to hear has been 
			an amazing first chapter 
			in my new life as a musician
<br><br>
			I hope you enjoy the journey
			and maybe it will help you to
			make more sense of your own
<br><br>
			Love you all
			<br>
			beanie !
